# Visual-Cryptography-using-RUBIK-S-CUBE-PRINCIPLE
In this project we developed a code for more secure and fast encryption of images using a unique image encryption algorithm based on Rubik's cube principle. 

  The pixels of the image are shuffled in a way similar to that of a Rubik’s cube in a random manner using two randomly generated vectors. Then the same vectors are used for performing bitwise operation row-wise and column-wise. The XOR operator is applied to odd rows and columns of image using a key to decrease the association between original and encrypted images. The same key is flipped and applied to even rows and columns of image.
  Finally, the algorithm which we used to develop the encryption system (Rubik's cube principle) not only can achieve good encryption standards and perfect hiding ability but also can resist exhaustive attack, statistical attack and differential attack.

  The Rubik's cube principle implemented in this project is described in the following research paper. “Loukhaoukha, K., Chouinard, J. Y., & Berdai, A. (2012). A secure image encryption algorithm based on Rubik's cube principle. Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2012, 7”
